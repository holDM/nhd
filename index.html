                    <h3>Transcendentalism (Drawing on 11-8, Textbook, Walden?)</h3>

                    <div class="flavor">
                        <p>
                        Transcendentalist philosophy thrived alongside religion during the Second Great
                        Awakening, encouraging individual thought and an inward focus when viewing the world.
                        This philosophy focused especially on a sense of natural order and the concept that a
                        person should do what they would despite criticism (11-8). This led to some issues given
                        that some proponents of this, such as Henry David Thoreau, used this logic to resist paying
                        taxes, and led to his eventual jailing for a short time. Proponents of this were Ralph
                        Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman among others (Textbook).

                        As religious and philosophical movements blossomed in the Second Great Awakening,
                        these ideas were put into action in the development of “utopian” communities. Many
                        of these communities were communist in nature, sharing all components of life to a
                        certain degree, such as the Oneida community established by John Humphrey Noyes,
                        which tried to achieve this communal ideal and justify such communal living as being
                        equivalent to Christian life after death (11-12). While this community eventually
                        failed at becoming self-sufficient, it was a key example of such movements (Textbook).

                        As the Second Great Awakening progressed, many of the movements it created were revivalist
                        movements. These movements aimed to “revive” Christianity by recognizing sins on the part
                        of the current church as well as the congregation and using repentance as a tool to renew
                        their piety and faith (11-4). Proponents of this included Charles G. Finney and Leland Beecher.

                        <p>
                        Mormonism came into existence following Joseph Smith’s claim that he had a holy
                        epiphany in which he was given a new gospel of the Bible and a command to found
                        a new church based around said gospel (10-1). Due to its rejection of common
                        Christian tradition, they were ostracized, persecuted, and eventually forced into
                        exile in the Western territories. A key example of this was the eventual murder of
                        Joseph Smith in Illinois (Textbook, p341-342).

                        Utah was settled by Mormon settlers led by Brigham Young in an attempt to escape
                        from the religious persecution that had plagued them in the East and Midwestern US,
                        leading to the founding of Salt Lake City. Mormonism’s position as the dominant
                        religion in this area led to later disputes with the East, especially concerning polygamy.

                        The Mormon War was a short-lived and bloodless conflict in which a body of soldiers
                        was sent to Utah and then quickly recalled with the purpose of outlawing polygamy
                        in the territory. This was resolved by its banning (without enforcement) in Utah (Textbook, p342-343).

                    <div class="flavor">
                        Given the traditional concept of “separate spheres” for each gender, the prospect of any work for women caused significant ideological conflict. Women were only employed at factories (through methods such as the Lowell system) prior to the Second Great Awakening, but gained more power in religious communities as organizers and advocates during this time. A significant form of employment for women that emerged within this period was that of schoolteachers, as demand grew due to educational reform. While this was a conflict with traditional views, some compromise was reached through the limited extent of female employment.

                    <div class="flavor">
                        Ideological conflict resulted from women’s role in political movements as well. When women began to campaign and advocate on behalf of their own cause and others, it conflicted with the entire concept of “separate spheres” for each gender. Additionally, this bolstered other causes such as educational reform and abolitionism as well as the campaign for women’s rights. Governmental compromise was reached on this through the successes of the women’s rights movement in achieving their political goals.

                        Horace Mann was a leading educational reformer who worked to create public education in the US. He argued that education was a key part of a successful society and republic – that education would help to alleviate poverty and provide a background from which citizens could form their views in political discourse (11-11). He campaigned for the expansion of elementary schools and basic education of the American citizenry. His efforts helped lead to longer school terms, standards for teaching basic skills, and the widespread hiring of educated women as teachers (Textbook).

                        <p>
                        The expansion of education in the US was driven by its perceived necessity in a healthy democracy, as argued by Horace Mann, and by its perceived economic benefit (11-11). Education was also given religious justification, as seen in some passages in the article “Early Habits of Industry,” which appeared in The Mother’s Magazine in 1834. This article stated that an attitude of industry had to be instilled in children from a young age by providing various tasks ranging from the clerical to the menial. While not directly mentioned in this article, education from a young age provides a similar constant and predictable set of tasks as are mentioned (11-3). Additionally, this movement received some support from women’s rights activists due to the employment it provided to women at the time (Textbook).

                        <p>
                        As public schools spread across the US, some consternation developed concerning the role of religion in such institutions. Catholics were one especially concerned group, as evidenced in the “Petition of the Catholics of New York,” which expressed their worries that their children would not receive sufficient religious education and that any that they received would be protestant in nature (11-7). Some of this effect may have been intentional due to nativist sentiments that clashed especially with predominantly Catholic Irish populations (Textbook).
